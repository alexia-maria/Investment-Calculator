# Investment Calculator

Built with Angular, HTML, and CSS, the application begins with a form where users can input their initial investment amount, annual contributions, desired investment duration, and expected return.

Upon submission, the application calculates and displays a table showing annual investment details, including total contributions and interest earned, based on custom-defined functions. Key Angular features utilized in this project include two-way data binding and custom event handling, enhancing user interaction and data management.

Interfaces are used to manage different data types effectively, while an injectable service class contains the applicationâ€™s core logic, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.
